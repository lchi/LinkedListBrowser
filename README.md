==========

A Ruby Domain Specific Language (DSL) for accessing LinkedListNYC entries.  What is the [LinkedList](http://www.linkedlistnyc.org)?

Usage
-----

	pry(main)> issue = LinkedListNYC.issue_005 # gets you issue # 5
	pry(main)> issue.css('a').map { |x| x.attributes['href'].to_s }
	 => ["*|ARCHIVE|*",	      
	  "http://www.meetup.com/openny/events/16755815/",
	  "http://www.meetup.com/PythonBrooklyn/events/16931174/",
	  "http://www.meetup.com/lisp-59/events/16908923/",
	  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Meetup/NYC",
	  "http://www.nycruby.org/events/16179487/",
	  "mailto:tips@linkedlistnyc.org",
	  "http://twitter.com/linkedlistnyc",
	  "*|UNSUB|*"]

Generally...

	LinkedListNYC.issue_<issueNo> where issueNo is a three digit number

This will give you a ``Nokogiri::HTML::Document`` which you can then manipulate.  Access individual entries this way.  To download and cache entries use ``LinkedListNYC.download_and_cache``.  Downloaded docs will be stored as ``./linkedlist_issues/0xx.html``.

Requirements
------------

	$ gem install nokogiri
